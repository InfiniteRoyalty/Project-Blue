        <p>A lake is a body of water that is surrounded by land. There are millions of lakes in the world. They are found on every continent and in every kind of environment—in mountains and deserts, on plains, and near seashores.</p>
        <img src="images/lakes/pexels-james-wheeler-417074.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Lakes vary greatly in size. Some measure only a few square meters and are small enough to fit in your backyard. Such small lakes are often referred to as ponds. Other lakes are so big that they are called seas.</p>

        <p>The water in lakes comes from rain, snow, melting ice, streams, and groundwater seepage. Most lakes contain freshwater.</p>

        <p>All lakes are either open or closed. If water leaves a lake by a river or other outlet, it is said to be open. All freshwater lakes are open. If water only leaves a lake by evaporation, the lake is closed. Closed lakes usually become saline, or salty. This is because as the water evaporates, it leaves behind solids—mostly salts.</p>
